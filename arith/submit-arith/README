ARCHITECTURE:
    40image.c: Compresses and decompresses files, as specified in 
               commandline arguments
    Compress and Decompress are implemented in inverse order, where each 
    function has an analagous function in the opposite process. We divided
    the functions into several categories: 
        - mapping functions: used for mapping from one pixel representation
                             to another (typically apply functions that 
                             map from one array to another)
        - transformation:    used for actual calculations when mapping from
                             one type to another
        - printing functions
        - compression functions
        - decompression functions
        - other functions/utility functions
    
    Bitpack.c
        Contains functions used to pack, unpack, codewords.

    A2Methods Files/Functions: Allow 2D array modification, access, etc.

HELP RECEIVED:
